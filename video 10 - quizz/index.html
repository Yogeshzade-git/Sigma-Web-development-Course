        <p id="para">Complex problems often call for collaborative solutions, and team players will be increasingly needed. While it can seem like a solitary occupation, coding requires more teamwork than one might think. Some projects call for team members to focus on a certain aspect, such as visuals, for example. With programming, the ability to effectively work with others to find solutions can be nurtured from a young age. Many people have been intimidated at some point by math and, try as they might, they could never quite grasp it. Children who learn coding, however, tend to not struggle as much while learning about formulations of numbers and letters. Not only are they generally less fearful of math, but coding helps students’ math skills grow and flourish. In fact, coding helps bring abstract mathematical concepts to life, since students can more easily visualize them. This makes math more enjoyable fun, even. Coding promotes and stimulates critical and logical thinking. Rather than focus exclusively on writing lines of coding, programming also teaches students to take a complicated issue and reduce it to smaller, more manageable pieces so it can be solved, step by step. It’s a skill that can be used throughout life, in nearly every area.It’s human nature for many people, once they encounter an obstacle or challenge, to throw in the towel. Coders don’t think that way. Students who grew up programming in school tend to view such situations as a problem to fix not a sign to give up. Instead of fearing failure, programmers seek out the fastest fixes. This kind of mentality is developed while learning to code and serves students well throughout life.</p>
